## Spring 2022

In this course we explore how societal issues of ethics, fairness, responsibility, and privacy affect the data science lifecycle. The data science lifecycle includes data acquisition, cleaning and pre-processing, analysis and use of data (we explore techniques from machine learning, inferential statistics, and causal inference), and communication of data science results. We will consider the steps one must follow to conduct data science tasks responsibly, and will delve into the details of fairness and privacy issues that arise along the way. The course has three components: lectures, programming assignments, and readings. Through the combination of these three, students who complete the course will learn how to conduct data science tasks responsibly, recognize fairness, privacy, and other important implications, and improve their programming and technical skillset.

**Offline/Asynchronous discussion:** We will use [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/GF98AE2F7/feed) for offline discussion. You can think of Campuswire as Piazza or Ed. If you need to discuss a private matter then send me an email instead.
 
### Schedule

The schedule [is available here](schedule.md).

The schedule includes lecture topics, readings, as well as the dates where all assignments will be released and due. Make sure to check the schedule often, as I expect there will be some adjustments to the dates throughout the quarter.

### Grading

- **Programming Assignments (4 in total. 7% each. Total 28%).** The programming assignments are an important component of your grade. You can find the tentative release dates in the schedule. You can work on these assignments in pairs and you need to indicate how did you collaborate on each of the assignments.
- **Programming Assignments Quiz (5%)** A quiz towards the end of the quarter with questions about the programming assignments. This will be easy if you've done the work on the programming assignments throughout the quarter.
- **Reading Responses (6 in total. 2% each. Total 12%)** We will assign readings each week. At the end of the week we will ask a question about the readings and ask you to provide a brief answer.
- **Individual Project (40%)** A big component of your grade. You will engage in a quarter-long individual project. You will deliver a short report and present your work to the class during the two final sessions.
- **Responsibility/Ethics/Privacy Issue Report (12%)** In addition to the above, you will deliver a short (maximum 450 words) report where you detail an issue related to the topics covered in class throughout the quarter. In particular, the report should indicate the problem you've identified. Some valid topics include news in the media, books, articles, and others. If you are unsure about the topic, make sure you reach out to the instructor soon in the quarter to confirm. In addition to pinpointing the problem, this report should explain clearly why it's a problem, and what are some fixes or measures that one could take to ameliorate or avoid this issue in the future. 
- **Class Participation (3%).** *A small part of your grade comes from participation. If your grade ends up on a border between two grades (e.g. B+ and A-) this can sway your grade. Participation can be earned in several ways: i) being active on Campuswire, i.e., answering and commenting on questions (asking questions on Campuswire does not count) ii) actively engaging in discussion and asking questions in class.* 

### Academic Integrity Policy

The University of Chicago has formal policies related to academic honesty and plagiarism, as described by the university broadly and the college specifically. We abide by these standards in this course. Depending on the severity of the offense, you risk being dismissed altogether from the course. All cases will be referred to the Dean of Students office, which may impose further penalties, including suspension and expulsion. If you have any question about whether some activity would constitute cheating, please feel free to ask. In addition, we expect all students to treat everyone else in the course with respect, following the norms of proper behavior by members of the University of Chicago community. 

Student interactions are an important and useful means to master course material. We recommend that you discuss the material in this class with other students. While it is acceptable to discuss assignments in general terms, it is not acceptable to turn in someone else's writing or code (or fragments thereof) as your own. When the time comes to write down your answer, you should write it down yourself from your own understanding. Moreover, you should cite any material discussions or written sources, e.g., "Note: I discussed this exercise with Jane Smith." If one student "helps" another by giving them a copy of their assignment, only to have that other student copy it and turn it in, both students are culpable. If you have any questions about what is or is not proper academic conduct, please ask an instructor. (This description of academic honesty is derived in part from those of Stuart Kurtz and John Reppy).
